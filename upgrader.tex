\section{Fluidized bed VPU}

The vapor phase upgrader (VPU) catalytically upgrades pyrolysis vapors from the pyrolyzer unit. The diagram shown Figure \ref{fig:upgrader} displays the process flows and basic geometry of the fluidized bed VPU system. Heat jackets and insulation around the VPU are used to maintain temperature within the system. All dimensions were taken from the technical drawing M\_FTLB\_155-01 and from email correspondence with Rick French.

The inlet gas at the bottom of the VPU is a combination of pyrolysis vapors and nitrogen gas. Zeolite catalyst is used as the bed material in the VPU. Properties of the catalyst as measured by NETL are available in the table below.

An HZSM-5 catalyst is the bed material for the vapor phase upgrader. Particle size ranges from 300 to 1000 um. Coking effect is typically 10\%. The silica to alumina ratio (SAR) is 30:1. Residence time in the reactor is generally 14 minutes. Silca binder SiO$_2$ is 20\% by weight, acid site concentration 960 umol/g and BET surface area of 370 m$^2$/g.
