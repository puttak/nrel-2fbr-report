\section{Introduction}

This report is for the NREL 2FBR biomass fast pyrolysis system which is comprised of a two-inch diameter fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor and a fluidized bed vapor phase upgrader. Experiment data and apparatus information were provided by Rick French and Kristiina Iisa of NREL. Computational models discussed in this report were developed by Gavin Wiggins of ORNL.

The NREL 2FBR system is operated at fast pyrolysis conditions to thermochemically convert biomass feedstock into gas, tar, and char products. Pyrolysis occurs in a fluidized bed reactor comprised of sand and biomass particles. The pyrolysis vapors are upgraded in a separate fluidized reactor that contains a bed of catalyst particles. See Figure \ref{fig:2fbr-system} for an overview of the pyrolysis and vapor phase upgrader reactors.
