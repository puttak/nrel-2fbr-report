\section{Introduction}

This documentation is for the 2FBR system at NREL which is comprised of a two-inch diameter fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor and a fluidized bed vapor phase upgrader. Computational models developed by the CCPC are based on the information provided in this documentation.

Experiments are conducted on the 2FBR system by Rick French, Danny Carpenter, and Kristiina Iisa of NREL. Computational models of the system are developed by Emilio Ramirez, Gavin Wiggins, Charles Finney, Jessica Torres, and Jonathan Sutton of ORNL.

The 2FBR system is operated at fast pyrolysis conditions to thermochemically convert biomass feedstock into gas, tar, and char products. Pyrolysis occurs in a fluidized bed reactor comprised of sand and biomass particles. The pyrolysis vapors are upgraded in a separate fluidized reactor that contains a bed of catalyst particles. Information such as geometric dimensions, process flows, and operating conditions are provided in the following sections. A references page contains a list of technical documents and publications relevant to the system.
